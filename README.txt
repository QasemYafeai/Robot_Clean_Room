# Robot Room Cleaning Simulation By Qasem Yafeai 

This project simulates robots cleaning a room process in real-time using Python. The simulation allows users to specify the dimensions of the room, the number of robots, and choose whether to see the time taken to clean a target percentage of the room or the percentage cleaned within a given time.


# USER GUIDE : 

1 - Enter Room Dimensions: You will be prompted to enter the width and height of the room. Ensure you enter positive integers.

2 - Enter Number of Robots: Specify the number of robots to clean the room. Ensure you enter a positive integer.

# Choose Simulation Mode:

- Enter 'time' to see the time taken to clean a target percentage of the room.

- Enter 'percentage' to see the percentage cleaned within a given time.

# Enter Target Value:

- If you chose 'time', enter the target percentage to be cleaned (between 0 and 100).

- If you chose 'percentage', enter the time limit in seconds (positive number).



## EXAMPLE RUN : 

Enter width for the room : 14
Enter height for the room : 16
Enter how many robots to clean the room : 3
Choose 'time' to see time that takes to clean a room targeting a percentage or choose 'percentage' to see the percentage cleaned in a given time: time
Enter the target percentage to be cleaned: 20
Robot initialized at : 1 , 8
Robot initialized at : 8 , 8
Robot initialized at : 3 , 3
Robot has moved to 6 , 15
Robot has moved to 2 , 14
Robot has moved to 0 , 0
Frame: 0, Cleaned Percentage: 1.34%


Thank you.
